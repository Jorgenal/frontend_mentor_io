# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).

Only web-version. Mobile ignored for now. Trying to get feet on the ground for some front-end work. Mainly doing it for fun, so not filling out the README template as designed.
